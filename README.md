Suburban Farm

A web app to enabling suburban farmers to connect with urban consumers that want to reduce food waste and support the local community.

We created this web app with the intention of supporting the local community whilst reducing the amount of food waste per household.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
